## Introdution

Hi there! I'm Phoenix.

Like many of you, I had a rough start. I discovered Skyrim modding through gameplay videos on YouTube and was fascinated by the endless possibilities. And then I, too, installed dozens of mods through Nexus Mod Manager, ran LOOT, and tore my hair out over seemingly inexplicable and unfixable random crashes, not to mention the bugs and issues, and the mods that I could never get to work as advertised.

Many frustrating experiences, crashes and aborted playthroughs later, I began to understand the effort required of me to get that beautiful, personalised Skyrim I was aiming for. In 2017, I published what I had learned as a guide - The Phoenix Flavour. Since then, I have learned a lot and TPF has grown with me. Today it is a well-established modding guide.

This repository collects my various projects for Skyrim Special Edition, first and foremost my Phoenix Flavour guide. The intention is to provide a solid base for newcomers to the Skyrim SE modding scene, covering the three available options. These are:

- **Installing mods manually**, building your own setup. This allows the user to customise everything about their game, pick and choose mods to fit their vision and hardware. You will be required to invest a sizeable amount of time, reading and watching guides. This is a deep rabbit hole and in order to create a stable mod setup, you need an advanced understanding of how mods function as well as how to edit them so that they work alongside each other.
- **Following a guide**, installing the guide author's chosen set of mods. While this usually removes a lot of the customisability that modding offers, there are plenty of different guides to choose from that cater to different visions and playstyles. Completing a guide will require a substantial time investment, although getting a stable setup will take nowhere near as long as starting off without a guide will. If anything, a guide will teach you how to install, configure and utilise the modding tools available as well as how to edit mods in order to create a stable, consistent game.
- **Using Wabbajack** to automatically install one of the available setups. For those who cannot or do not wish to invest the time into learning how to mod (with or without a full guide), there is the Wabbajack tool with which one can quickly and effortlessly install a full modded setup with a fraction of the time that was required in its original creation. There are plenty of different Wabbajack lists available for Skyrim SE.

## Misconceptions

New arrivals in the modding community often come with a list of about one hundred mods and crash reports. These desperate help requests usually sound a bit like "but I jumped off the roof and I did flap my arms like bird wings". The fact that you need a parachute and something higher to jump off of seems so painfully obvious to community veterans, they roll their eyes, and turn away. To newcomers, this is extremely frustrating and obviously unhelpful.

But what feels like gatekeeping is very much unintentional in most cases, and many members of the community are simply tired of explaining the very basics over and over. In turn many newcomers are unaware that in order to get the list of mods they compiled for themselves to work, they’ll need to invest quite a bit more time.

Let me elaborate a little on what "more work" entails specifically. You need a proper mod manager, for Skyrim Special Edition that is Mod Organizer 2, and you need to know how to handle it. You need to have all requirements installed correctly, particularly the Script Extender and the Unofficial Patch. You need a proper load order, and no, LOOT is not sufficient. You need to download patches for your mods and fix the remaining conflicts on your own.

First and foremost, you have to understand how your mods work and how you can tweak them so that they work well together.

For a list of 50 mods and upwards this is non-negotiable. Of course you can skip all steps, install your mods manually and load them wherever, but you cannot expect them all to work perfectly and as advertised. If you go that way - and even if it sounds harsh - you cannot expect any help whatsoever. Because why would others invest time into explaining to you what you did not want to research yourself?

## Getting Started

Home is behind, the world ahead - every good journey begins with a Tolkien quote. Before you lies a choice that will determine how soon you will be able to jump into modded Skyrim, and how much you learned on the way.

### Building your own setup.

This first option is the proverbial jump into very cold water and I would not recommend any newcomer to begin here. However, if you are determined to build your own setup and willing to put in the effort required, I would direct you to my **SkyPlus** guide (which you can find here in this repository). It will lead you through the initial setup of Skyrim and all required tools plus explain to you the basics of modding.

### Following a guide.

Anyone who wants to learn how to mod Skyrim properly should start here. Good guides are fantastic resources that will not only provide you with your first modded gameplay experience but also hold your hand on the journey there. Since I am biased, I would of course recommend **The Phoenix Flavour**, my own guide which is available here in this repository. You can find a detailed overview over most available Skyrim SE modding guides (including information on content and structure) in the Resources folder on this repository.

### Using Wabbajack.

Learning how to mod Skyrim may not be fun to everyone and if you do not enjoy the process, it is not worth the time investment. Other people may be interested in learning, but lack the time to do so.

Thankfully there is **Wabbajack**, an auto installer that helps you re-create a more experienced modder’s setup on your computer with minimal effort. If you do decide to go down that route, I recommend reading (or at least skimming through) the "Introduction to Modding" section before installing [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/).

> By the way - my own guide, The Phoenix Flavour, is also available as a Wabbajack installer.

## Discord

On our dedicated Discord server for The Phoenix Flavour, we are providing support for the main guide as well as the Wabbajack version of TPF. We are also talking guide changes, Skyrim modding, and gaming in general. Feel free to join us [here](https://discord.gg/BpwXX5f)!

## Future Plans

My primary concern is the main guide - The Phoenix Flavour for Skyrim SE. The guide is being updated regularly with new mods and improvements.

I also work on a Beginner's Guide (SkyPlus) that I would like to add a "DIY Kit" section to in the future which is supposed to provide resources for the building of a custom setup. While it cannot contain any specifics, there are still many general rules and tips to give about the creation of a setup. Because this is fairly complex, I've had it on the backburner for a long, long time.

Whenever I'm fed up with Kyne's Peace and SKYRIM BELONGS TO THE NORDS, I hide in Boston for a bit. My Fallout 4 list is still in an early WIP stage but I am planning to release it as a Wabbajack installer eventually.

## Credits

The Phoenix Flavour guide could never exist in its current complexity without **Umgak** who has found herself in charge of the conflict resolution for the entire guide. Umgak is also our resident expert on all things modding.

I would also like to give thanks to:
- Faron, Cassi, Slim and D1Z4STR (who are currently my Discord moderators)
- Lively (thanks for that Wabbajack stuff bby)
- DarkLadyLexy (use her guide if you are interested in LOTD)
- All the current and past contributors.
- Everyone who has been active on our server, leaving screenshots and feedback.
- And of course my lovely Patreons!
