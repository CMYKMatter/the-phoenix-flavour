# Tweaks

- Added Respawns flag to Beehives and increased amount of bees found inside.
- Removed bees as loot from Vacant Beehives.
- Removed the Flames and Healing spells from the player character.
- Praying at a shrine will no longer cure diseases. All Skyrim and DLC shrines are affected.
- Jenassa is now wearing a set of Chitin armor appropriate to her race.
- Added Wolf Gloves to Skjor because he wasn't wearing any for some reason.
