# Smithing

### Silver and Gold

In vanilla, it's easy to level smithing and get rich by crafting jewellery. Adapting CCOR changes, I added conditions to the crafting recipes.

- Jewellery made from silver requires Smithing 30 or higher.
- Jewellery made from gold requires Smithing 60 or higher.
- Bone Hawk Ring and Bone Hawk Amulet require the first smithing perk (Basic Styles).

### Ore Smelting

- Doubled the amount of ore needed for one ingot (2 > 4).
- Silver ingots can be crafted at Smithing level 30.
- Gold ingots can be crafted at Smithing level 60.
- Other ingots were tied to their crafting perks.
- Steel ingots now require 1 iron ingot and 3 charcoal sticks.

### Dwemer Scrap Metal to Ingot

Changed ratios for Dwarven Scrap Metal to Ingots conversion. Numbers in brackets is the weight of the scrap metal piece as defined by WACCF. The ratios are copied over from CCOR because they just make sense: 1 Dwarven Metal Ingot is made of 6 weight units of scrap metal.

- 4 Dwemer Scrap Metal (1.5) > 1 Dwarven Metal Ingot
- 3 Dwemer Bent Scrap Metal (2) > 1 Dwarven Metal Ingot
- 1 Dwemer Small Plate Metal (6) > 1 Dwarven Metal Ingot
- 1 Dwemer Large Metal Plate (12) > 2 Dwarven Metal Ingot 
- 1 Dwemer Large Strut (36) > 6 Dwarven Metal Ingot
- 1 Dwemer Large Decorative Strut (42) > 7 Dwarven Metal Ingot

Converting Dwemer Scrap Metal into Dwarven Metal Ingots requires the Dwarven smithing perk (Intermediate Styles).

### Temper Changes

- The Blade of Woe can now be tempered with an Ebony ingot (instead of a Steel ingot).
- Dragon Priest Daggers can now be tempered with a Corundum ingot (instead of a Dwarven Metal Ingot).

### Shellbug Helmet

In vanilla, the Shellbug helmet (added in Dawnguard) has no crafting requirements but stats better than Ebony. The crafting requirements are taken from CCOR.

- The Shellbug helmet now requires the Ebony smithing perk (Advanced Styles).
- Crafting now requires 1 Leather, 1 Leather Strip, and 1 Ebony ingot (instead of iron).
