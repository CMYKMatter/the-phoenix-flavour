# Timing Is Everything

### Dawnguard

### Hearthfire

Minimum level was set to 30. This should give you sufficient time to become the famed Dragonborn that the jarls will address you as in the DLC.

### Dragonborn

- After Dragonslayer. I typically take my time with the main quest, travelling to where it continues, then dig through the area's quests. Dragonborn has the highest level enemies and rewards, and with Dragonslayer (killing Alduin) as a requirement, you will be at an appropriate level and an accomplished Dragonborn upon reaching Solstheim.
