# Timing Is Everything

### Dawnguard

### Hearthfire

Minimum level was set to 30. This should give you sufficient time to become the famed Dragonborn that the jarls will address you as in the DLC.

### Dragonborn

- **After Dragonslayer**. I typically take my time with the main quest, travelling to where it continues, then dig through the area's quests. Dragonborn has the highest level enemies and rewards, and with Dragonslayer (killing Alduin) as a requirement, you will be at an appropriate level and an accomplished Dragonborn when you arrive on Solstheim.

### Encounters

- **Werewolf Encounters:** Toggled on. These encounters can now occur as soon as the player reaches level 8 and regardless of whether they joined the Companions. More Werewolves (the mod) adds more werewolf encounters to the world.
- **Thalmor Squad:** Requires Diplomatic Immunity to be completed first so that the Thalmor have a reason to hunt the player in the first place. Level requirement was untouched (default level 8).
- **Hired Thugs - Stolen Value:** Set to 500. You will be hunted by hired thugs after stealing items with a total value of more than 500 septims from the same owner.
- **Hired Assassin:**
- **Bounty Collector:** Default options. There is a 25% chance you will be hunted down by bounty collectors when amassing a bounty of more than 1000 septims.
