# Creation Club (WIP)

## Official Stance

I am planning to officially support at least some "creations" in the future. Please check the list of "creations" here for more information on their compatibility with the guide.

## 11.2 Creations

| Name                  | Status         |
| --------------------- | ------------   |
| Saints & Seducers     | `incompatible` |

## 11.3 Saints & Seducers

This "creation" was added with the 1.5.97 update and came with some navmesh changes in Solitude. During the Setup of the guide, there are instructions to delete the new navmesh in order to prevent conflicts with other mods that can result in crashes.
