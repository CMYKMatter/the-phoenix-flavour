## Weapons

### WACCF Changes

- The vanilla progression - Orcish > Dwarven > Elven - is swapped around to be more consistent with existing perks and lore: Dwarven > Elven > Orcish.
- In vanilla, Dragonbone weapons are superior to Daedric weapons. WACCF switches their stats around so that Daedric weapons are the strongest in the game now.

### Tiers

- Iron
- Steel
- Silver
- Dwarven
- Nord Hero
- Skyforge Steel
- Elven
- Nordic
- Orcish
- Glass
- Stalhrim
- Ebony
- Dragonbone
- Daedric

### Availability

- Elven, Dwarven and Orcish weapons found in the logical locations.
- Glass+ weapons are extremely rare.
- Dragonbone and Daedric weapons are crafting only.

### Daedric Weapons

- Either I take away their regular weapons entirely and replace them with Ebony / Daedric level bound weapons. This is what Morrowloot does so I'd just have to snip out that change.

Another way to obtain Daedric equipment would be to buy it off the Dremora Merchant which you can summon after acquiring one of the Black Books on Solstheim. I was considering to restrict his inventory to Daedric equipment which would then allow non-smithing characters to buy Daedric stuff.

## Leveled Items

Should either be unleveled or leveled with the option to *upgrade* them. See Blessings of the Daedra.

Hybrid Loot *unlevels* unique items.

## Morrowloot Miscellania

### Hybrid Loot Changes:

- Removed Encounter Zone changes.

### Phoenix Loot

- DLC1 dragons can no longer drop Daedric equipment (forwarded from MLU).
- No loot from burned corpses (but why are they interactible then?).
- Set Chance None to 100 for LItemMiscVendorLockpicks75.
- Removed lockpicks from:
  - LootCitizenPocketsCommon
  - LootCitizenPocketsPoor
  - LootCitizenPocketsRich

#### To Do

- Implement CLLF change for Imperial quartermaster chests (give them Imperial weapons and armor).

### Dremora Bound Weapons

Dremora no longer drop fire enchanted leveled weapons and iron daggers. The daggers were removed entirely and the leveled weapons replaced by bound weapons (bow and arrow for the archers, sword and battleaxe for the melees). This is a MLU feature, but with a slightly different implementation.
